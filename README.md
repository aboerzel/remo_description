## Usage

This is a ROS package which should be cloned in a catkin workspace.
To use `remo_description` inside a Gazebo simulation or on a real 3D printed Remo robot, you can directly make use of the ROS packages in the 
[ros-mobile-robots/diffbot](https://github.com/ros-mobile-robots/diffbot) repository. 
Most of the launch files you find in the `diffbot` repository
accept a `model` argument. Just append `model:=remo` to the end of a `roslaunch` command to make use of this `remo_description` package.
